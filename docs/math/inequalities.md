### Is it the inverse of a number?

On a general form, absolute values can represent themselves in two ways. Most of the reason why some may be in be confusion as to why absolute values can be misrepresented as the inverse of a number has to do with the logic of the application.

### The definition

$|x| = \Biggl\{\ x, if x \geq 0 \Biggl\}$

The same property can be applied for the value of $-x$, if $x < 0$, as shown below:

$|x| = \Biggl\{\ -x, if x > 0 \Biggl\}$
