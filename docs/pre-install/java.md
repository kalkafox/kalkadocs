### Installing Java

:::tip
This step is only necessary if you do not have Java installed.  
You can check if Java is installed by running `java -version`  
If you already have **Java 64-bit** installed, feel free to move on to the [installation guide](/docs/wolfpack/wolfpack-odin/install).
:::

1. Download Java from the official website. You should only be required to download the **(64-bit)** version. Do not install 32-bit Java.
2. Double click on the Java installer and follow the procedures to install which should not take too long. Feel free to move on to the MultiMC installation process.
