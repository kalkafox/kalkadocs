:::tip
Already have MultiMC? Feel free to move on to the [installation guide](/docs/wolfpack/odin/install).
:::

1. With this modpack, we will be using MultiMC as it is the most modular, flexible and lightweight solution for distributing modpacks. That being said, head over to the [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/#Download) download page and select the version catered to your operating system.
2. Once downloaded, you should be able to extract the `.zip` file into another directory as shown below.

3. Navigate into the directory and safely launch the `MultiMC.exe` program. You will then be given a first-time install process. After which you may then configure MultiMC to your liking.
