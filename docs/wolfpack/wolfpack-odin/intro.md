### Introduction
This document will cover an installation guide and a fully fledged mod list which should hopefully provide some insight on what's to come.

For those of you who are inclined to proceed with the process of installation, feel free. It is very simple, and setting up modpacks can take some time, but I have arranged this guide and some tools I've built to make the process more efficient and less time consuming. Feel free to message me with any troubleshooting you might encounter. Good luck!

### What is Wolfpack Odin?

Wolfpack Odin is the release title for a custom Minecraft modpack, which while intended to be rich in features, also intends to be as lightweight as possible for the average consumer to be able to play with the least amount of issues. With the fast and dedicated move to <strong>1.16</strong>, mods have become much less costly to the game's code, and implementations in later versions have given rise to a more stable environment. Let's have some fun!
